/**
 * Durable code mode: a tool that runs model-written JavaScript in a QuickJS sandbox, whose script survives a restart.
 *
 * Problem: a script is in-memory VM state. A restart while
 *
 *     const results = await Promise.all(paths.map((path) => tools.read({ path })));
 *
 * waits for the last of 200 reads would lose the script and every read it made.
 *
 * Solution: deterministic replay (`CodemodeSandboxBase.start()` in pi-codemode). The VM only runs when the host hands
 * it a result; given the same start data, clock, seed, and results in the same order, it makes the same calls with
 * the same arguments. The tool is replay-safe: after a restart, `execute()` runs again, starts the script again from
 * the stored start data, and hands it the results it got before, in the order it got them, from a journal written
 * before each delivery. Nested tool calls reattach to their tasks by key (`c<VM call id>`), so they never run twice
 * unless their own replay policy reruns them; their results come from `NestedCallDoc`. Then the script continues live.
 *
 * Documents, scoped to the code mode call's task and gone when it settles:
 * - `pi.codemode.run`: the start data, written once before the VM starts, and the outcome, written once when the call
 *   decides it (with the store writes, in one transaction), so a rerun after that returns it without a VM.
 * - `pi.codemode.journal`: one entry per delivered result, in delivery order: the VM call ID, the clock value, the
 *   calls the VM had issued after processing it (once acknowledged), and a global's outcome, which nothing else stores.
 *
 * Each result's acknowledged call count is recorded with the next journal commit, or at once when the VM has processed
 * everything delivered: a script waiting on a long call is where a restart usually finds it. A sequential script
 * therefore costs one journal commit and one count commit per result, on top of its nested calls' own; that is the
 * price of checking the most common crash point.
 *
 * A call is launched only once the count of calls issued in the drain that made it is committed. So every key an earlier
 * attempt admitted is at most its last recorded count; a replay checks every recorded count, so when it releases its
 * calls it has made every call an earlier attempt could have admitted, and later calls are new.
 *
 * A rerun refuses to replay (no new nested calls; nested calls admitted earlier may still resume on their own and are
 * aborted by the call's cleanup) when this module's version or the VM's fingerprint changed, when the deadline passed,
 * or when the script diverges: it makes another call, or calls in another order, than the journal says. Each ends the
 * call with an error result.
